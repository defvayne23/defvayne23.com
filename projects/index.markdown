### Projects

Here is a list of projects I'm either working on, or have worked on. I like to create projects to tinker with things and learn new functionality and stay sharp on others.

**Working Projects:**

  * [Hidden-Tumblr](https://github.com/defvayne23/Hidden-Tumblr): Started as an idea for a Google Chrome extension to hide posts that I see too often. Added another feature that shows the last post you read the last time the page loaded. Need to rename it and launch into the app store.
  * [KaizenCMS](https://github.com/defvayne23/KaizenCMS):
  * [Groundwork](https://github.com/defvayne23/Groundwork): Taking what I learned from the first generation of KaizenCMS to create a new framework to better learn PHP OOP.
  * [Stratum](https://github.com/defvayne23/Stratum): Experimentation with creating a MySQL database layer in PHP. Seeing how much I can replicate of [MDB2](http://pear.php.net/package/MDB2/redirected) project.

**Stagnet Projects:**

  * [jTube](https://github.com/defvayne23/jTube): A jQuery plugin to easily pull data from the YouTube API.
  * [jTube-PHP](https://github.com/defvayne23/jTube-PHP): PHP version of jTube that takes it a step further with user authentication to view private data. Project was never finished.
  * [gMaps](https://github.com/defvayne23/gMaps): Started as a way to learn the Google Maps API. Turned into a jQuery plugin to easily create interactive maps. Last thing I worked on was plugin that could easily create both interactive and image maps based off the same data.
  * [Whiteboard](https://github.com/defvayne23/Whiteboard): Project I started to move our project organization from the whiteboard to a web app. Idea was to turn it into a service for easy project management.
