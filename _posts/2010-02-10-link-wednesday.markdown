  * [PaperKilledRock.com](http://paperkilledrock.com/) - James Fleeting has started doing Quick Tip Tuesday posts. He kicks off his first tip with showing implementations of pseudo class :hover in css. Can't wait for what he comes up for next week.
  * [FlyingNoWhere.com](http://flyingnowhere.com/) - Site has a great collection of iPhone wallpapers. James Fleeting is working on an iPhone app to get these wallpapers onto your iPhone easier.
  * [DummyImage.com](http://dummyimage.com/) - Great method to create wire frames or for client sites that don't have content yet. Simply set the source to this website with the width and height in the url, and returns a dummy image with those dimensions.
