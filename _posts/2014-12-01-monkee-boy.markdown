It’s been almost 5 months since I joined [James Fleeting](http://iwasasuperhero.com/) at [Monkee-Boy](http://www.monkee-boy.com/). Not a week has gone by that James hasn’t asked if I wrote this post yet. Why it took me so long is for another post.

My first day was July 7th, 2014. It’s been a fun ride since then. I went from a slow job of working on a dashboard to the world that is client work. It’s an understatement I got complacent having an easy job. Sadly my code showed it and I knew it. So when James told me Monkee-Boy was looking for a developer and might be able to bring me on, I jumped at it. Didn’t think I was going to get the job. Thought they would go with someone with just enough experience. After a little back and forth, I was given an offer.

It’s been an awesome ride so far. Having something other than the same task every week to work on. Working with one of the best teams in Austin. My favorite part? Not taking direct calls and emails from clients. In previous jobs I have either only related with some or no co-workers at all. I feel I can relate with everyone. For instance, week before last we had a Team Fortress 2 lan party. Almost everyone was playing for the first time, but they had fun. I was accused of cheating because I had good gear from playing so much.

2014 is starting to wrap up. I look forward to what 2015 brings for Monkee-Boy and I. To continue growing as a developer with the team. James Fleeting hopes to leave Texas late in the year. Hopefully I can rise to the occasion and step into his role.
