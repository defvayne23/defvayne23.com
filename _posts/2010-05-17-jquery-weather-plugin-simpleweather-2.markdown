[monkeeCreate](http://monkeecreate.com/) has release another [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugin developed by [James Fleeting](http://paperkilledrock.com/) that uses the Yahoo Weather API to pull in weather data by just passing it a zipcode. Using [simpleWeather](http://simpleweather.monkeecreate.com/) is alot like [jTube](http://jtube.monkeecreate.com/) in the sense that you pass the zipcode and a function to handle the results. Example of some of the results passed back are high, low, sunrise, sunset, wind direction, current conditions and forecast.

Checkout simpleWeather on [jQuery Plugins](http://plugins.jquery.com/project/simpleWeather) and [GitHub](http://github.com/monkeecreate/jquery.simpleWeather).
