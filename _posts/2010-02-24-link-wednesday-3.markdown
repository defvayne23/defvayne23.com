  * [Project52](http://project52.info/) - The reason I started blogging. I have said I was going to for awhile, but this got me off the soap box and actually do it.
  * [kuler](http://kuler.adobe.com/#themes/random?time=30) - A site by Adobe. Good place to get color scheme ideas.
  * [TiltShift Generator](http://labs.artandmobile.com/tiltshift/) - Great online tilt shift tool. Also made for the iPhone.
