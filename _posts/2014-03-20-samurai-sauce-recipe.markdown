One of the things I miss from living in Wichita Falls, TX was going to Samurai of Tokyo. They have really good teppanyaki restaurant. What makes them special is the sauce they add to everything. Especially the rice. I knew that if I could get the sauce, I could make it myself. So either I have my family ship it to me, or I figure it out myself. Being adventurous I decided to make it myself. After a number of trials and Googling, I cracked it. Below is the recipe I use to make my own awesome stir fry at home. Have fun tweaking the recipe to your liking.
