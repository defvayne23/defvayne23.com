One of the things I miss from living in Wichita Falls, TX was going to Samurai of Tokyo. A great teppanyaki restaurant made special by the sauce they add to everything. Especially the rice. I knew that if I could get the sauce, I could make it myself. So either I have my family ship it to me, or I figure it out myself. Being adventurous I decided to make it myself. After a number of trials and Googling, I cracked it. Below is the recipe I use to make my own awesome stir fry at home. Have fun tweaking the recipe to your liking.
