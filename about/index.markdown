###About John

Born and raised Texan. Lived in the Wichita Falls area most of my life. Graduated from Iowa Park High School. I started my web development by creating an Angel Fire website at about 14. Learned some basic HTML from their site. Shortly after got my first editor, [CoffeeCup](http://www.coffeecup.com/). This was long before they had a WYSIWYG version. It included many Javascript snippets to add nifty things to your site. This helped me learn HTML and Javascript. Realizing my interesting development, I picked out a random coding book at my local book store. This is how I picked up PHP. After messing with that a bit, I got my first domain and shared hosting. I would come up with ideas to do for my site and learn how to make it happen. Took a web design class my junior year, but was beyond what the class could teach me. Starting my Senior year I was able to leave school early. I took advantage of this by looking for an internship at a local web development shop. It's been all coding and learning since then.
